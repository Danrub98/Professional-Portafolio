# homework-2
This website was made to display my personal portafolio as a web developer. The idea is that in the future,when looking for a job opening, the companies are able to look at my work, and be certain that I have the skill required to fit their needs. 

The portafolio needs to be a reflection of the personality of the programmer, because is the first link with the enterprises. I tried to make my website look as genuine as posible, playing with the colors so that they seem calm and professional at the same time. 

The website has the accesibility required for people that uses screen readers, all the images have an alternartive text, and the sections of the website are clearly displayed, also the classes where assigned to reflect what part of the website they belong and the impact they create.
